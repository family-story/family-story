# Family Story

Family Story is an augmented journaling and storytelling system to help your family stories to come to life. By imputing photos, audio, dates, locations and descriptions, the site then puts together a cohesive experience for the user to immerse them in the story. We hope that you enjoy it.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites / Installing

You will need to have a current version of node.js, and further, you will need to run npm instal to download all applicable packages. Further, you need a current version of the .env file. Please contact the development team for a current copy. Then run nodemon in the terminal.

## Running the tests

1) For the unit tests run npm test in the terminal.
2) For the functional tests, download cypress.io, open the cypress test interfaces, and click on the test files.
3) For the endpoint tests, download postman, and import/run the test suite found in the postman collection folder in the server folder.
